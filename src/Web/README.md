# Web Layer

The **Web** project contains the user interface and HTTP endpoints of the application.

## Responsibilities
- Controllers or Minimal APIs  
- Endpoint routing  
- Middleware and filters  
- Dependency injection setup for all layers  
- Hosting the frontend (Angular/React) if included  

## Dependencies
- Depends on **Application**, **Infrastructure**, and **Domain**

## Notes
This is the entry point of the application at runtime and composes all layers together.
